    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This no-bake skillet lasagna is made right on your stovetop and is a fast and easy alternative to store-bought hamburger mixes! The rest of this description is just going to be
        fluff because I don't want to have some heartfelt story about this lasanga and my deceased relative. It's a recipe from a website that I've never actually used.
        This lasagna means as much to me as the ingredients on their own; next to nothing. However being an Italian, I do love lasagna. So maybe I'm robbing myself of a great
        lasagna experience by not eating this. Who knows. Anywho, onto the ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional but you better use that shit)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1:</h3> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5-7 minutes. Drain and 
        discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><h3>Step 2:</h3> Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender 
        yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li><h3>Step 3:</h3> Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li><h3>Step 4:</h3> Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li><h3>Step 5:</h3> Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3-5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
